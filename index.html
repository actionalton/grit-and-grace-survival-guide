    <p><em>How to Keep Going When You're Burned Out, Broke, and Feeling Forgotten</em></p>

    <h2>My Story Snapshot</h2>
    <p>Burnout hits hard — mentally, spiritually, emotionally. I’ve been there. In the trenches of addiction, prison walls, sleepless nights, unpaid bills, and broken communication at home. You’re running on fumes, barely holding it together, praying for a sign that you ain’t invisible. This is that sign.</p>

    <h2>Name the Lies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>"God’s not listening."</li>
      <li>"I’m failing as a parent, partner, provider."</li>
      <li>"Nothing’s changing — I should just give up."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Speak the Truth</h2>
    <p>God has not forgotten you. Isaiah 49:15-16 says He’s written your name on His hands. Psalm 34:18 says He’s close to the brokenhearted. That means YOU. Right now.</p>

    <h2>3-Day Survival Reset</h2>
    <p><strong>Day 1:</strong> No junk food. Pray out loud. Stretch or walk 10 min. Read Psalm 13. Speak truth: “I’m not alone.”<br>
    <strong>Day 2:</strong> Eat protein early. Call someone. Read Romans 8. Move your body. Remind yourself: “God’s working even when I don’t see it.”<br>
    <strong>Day 3:</strong> Journal 3 things you're still grateful for. Get some sunlight. Read Isaiah 40. Say: “I’m in a fight, not a failure.”</p>

    <h2>Prayer for the Dark Days</h2>
    <p>God, I feel forgotten. I’m tired of pretending I’m okay. I need You to hold me together. Remind me You’re still with me, even here. I don’t need perfect — I just need real. You know my pain. You’ve seen my tears. Strengthen me for one more day. In Jesus’ name. Amen.</p>

    <h2>Affirmations to Fight Back</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>God’s not done with me.</li>
      <li>I can survive today — with Him.</li>
      <li>I’m not crazy — I’m under attack.</li>
      <li>Hope still breathes in my story.</li>
      <li>My struggle is real, but so is God’s grace.</li>
      <li>My weakness is where His strength shows up.</li>
      <li>I will not quit. I will rise again.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Closing Charge</h2>
    <p>You’re not weak. You’re in a battle. This ain't the end of your story. Don’t let the silence convince you that God’s not moving. He is. I’ve walked that fire and I’m telling you — don’t quit. Hold the line. Grit and grace will carry you through.</p>
